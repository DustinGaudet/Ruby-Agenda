# Ruby-Agenda
A program to create, update, delete, save and read conference agendas through terminal.

## Getting Started

Download the agenda.rb file. Navigate to the file in Terminal on OSX and use "ruby agenda.rb" to start the program. 

It is recommended you put this file in its own directory as the "Write to File" feature may write multiple .txt files to the directory.

### Prerequisites

This is only tested on Mac OSX Yosemite. Mac OSX should come with Ruby installed but you may want to upgrade to the latest version:

### Installing

2. Make sure the file is in a dedicated directory
